                <p>This website is created for a basketball enthusiast
                    who has five favorite basketball players. Here are
                    his explanations as to why these players became his idols: <br><br>
                    <em>"I am drawn to Kobe's beautiful footwork, smooth playing style,
                    and athleticism. Kobe's skills on the court left a lasting impression,
                    and his dedication to perfecting his craft serves as motivation to me.
                    I also admires LeBron's exceptional ball-handling skills, ability to
                    create plays, high basketball IQ, and his dedication to helping others.
                    I also recognizes LeBron's talent and impact on the game, even from his
                    high school days. Basta paborito ko siya. Aside, from the 2, I also sees
                    Kyrie as the best point guard due to his excellent dribbling abilities
                    and mastery of the jelly lay-up. Actually... we share the same position on
                    the court - point guard position (with wink). My top 4 is Curry since I
                    acknowledges his proficiency as a point guard and shooter. I also admire
                    his skill set and appreciate his hardworking nature on the basketball court.
                    Lastly, I idolizes MJ for his outstanding basketball skills, numerous
                    championship victories, and remarkable athleticism." </em> - DB stated
